##Front End Dev Test

The repo contains my solution for the Front End Dev Test provided by 'The White Agency'

Technology Used:

* Grunt
* Sass / Compass
* JQuery

###Notes

I coded this on a new laptop I am still yet to set up with Virtual machines so I have omitted any ie8 testing, but for the record the following would need to be done

* Add alternatives for any rgba colours, or transparency not supported by older ie versions
    - backround transparency can be achieved by using either of these methods
        + semi transparent png repeating background
        + second modal overlay with opacity value set with no child nodes
* Replace gradients with solid colours for older browsers
